# Scheduler
---
 Scheduler is a tool that allows you to keep track of all your events using a clean and simple interface. In the case where there are many overlapping events that you want to attend, Scheduler can help you sort out your options. We also introduced a sorting method that can optimize your schedule so you can attend the greatest number of events.
